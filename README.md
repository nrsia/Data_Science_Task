# Data_Science_Task
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning to extract insights from data. Data science is different from computer science and information science, but it uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. Data scientists examine which questions need answering and where to find the related data. They have business acumen and analytical skills as well as the ability to take data, understand it, process it, extract value from it, visualize it, and communicate it. They use complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and can solve issues like loan risk mitigation, pandemic trajectories, and contagion patterns
